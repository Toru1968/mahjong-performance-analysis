The Impact of Statistical Non-Randomness in Deal Sequences on Short-Term Competitive Performance
—An Attempt at the Quantitative Separation of Luck and Skill on an Online Mahjong Platform—

Author: (Toru Kyota)

Abstract
This study aims to investigate whether short-term performance fluctuation in online mahjong accurately reflects player skill by proposing an objective analytical method and presenting its efficacy as a case study. Focusing on the game logs of a specific player on the online mahjong platform "Mahjong Soul," we quantified the statistical bias of deal sequences (p-value) using a Runs Test and the luck of in-game draws by the number of shanten improvements from a draw (tsumo_adv). Furthermore, we conducted an analysis using composite indicators, including a fulfillment rate (fulfillment_rate) which shows the deviation from an AI's predicted score.

The analysis revealed that statistically significant biased sequences were observed with a frequency of 7.5%, approximately 30 times the theoretical expected value (0.25%). We also visualized that "initial luck" (p-value) and "draw luck" (tsumo_adv) are independent events, placing players in four distinct "luck environments" from "Tailwind" to "Storm."

From these results, we conclude that short-term performance is strongly influenced by the "luck environment" encountered and therefore cannot serve as an accurate indicator of skill. The analytical framework proposed in this study can serve as an aid for players to objectively analyze their performance fluctuations and investigate the causes of slumps.

1. Introduction
...(The content has been revised to clarify its positioning as a "methodology proposal and case study")...

Online mahjong has grown rapidly with the spread of the internet, establishing itself today as a large-scale, mind-based esport with millions of participants. Mahjong is a game where two complexly intertwined factors are at play: "skill," such as high-level strategy and situational judgment, and "luck," which is introduced by the deal and subsequent draws. While this duality is the profound appeal of mahjong, the question of whether short-term performance fluctuation accurately reflects a player's skill has long been a topic of debate within the player community.

In recent years, mahjong has also become a subject of advanced research in information science. Mahjong AIs such as Suphx, developed by Microsoft Research Asia, have demonstrated skill comparable to or exceeding top professionals by using deep learning and reinforcement learning, accelerating the movement to mathematically explore the definition of "optimal strategy" and "skill." Furthermore, the approach of statistically analyzing vast amounts of game data to derive advantageous strategies, known as "Mahjong Engineering," has become mainstream, spreading the recognition that "skill" is an accumulation of optimal, data-based decisions.

On the other hand, the fairness of platforms, particularly the black-box nature of the wall generation algorithms, creates a situation ripe for suspicion and frustration among players. While technical proposals have been made to address this issue, such as publishing the hash value of the wall before a game to prove non-intervention by the operator, this focuses primarily on preventing fraud and does not address the statistical properties of the outputted tile sequence itself. As a result, when players face a short-term slump, they are unable to objectively determine if it is due to their own lack of skill or a statistically biased run of "bad luck." This creates a challenge where players can suffer from excessive psychological stress, making it difficult to maintain a healthy engagement with the game.

Therefore, this paper presents a new perspective, different from prior research and discussions. The purpose of this paper is not to prove a universal truth, but rather to propose a new analytical methodology for separating "luck" and "skill" in online mahjong and to demonstrate its effectiveness through a single-player case study. Specifically, we define multiple objective indicators such as sequence bias (p-value), draw utility (tsumo_adv), and performance exceeding AI (fulfillment_rate), and use them to provide an intellectual framework for objectively viewing the causes of a slump.

The structure of this paper is as follows. Chapter 2 defines the analytical methodology. Chapter 3 presents the results of a case study applying this method. Chapter 4 discusses the results, and Chapter 5 presents the conclusions and future work.

2. Methodology
...(The formula for advantage_score has been corrected)...

This study conducted an analysis using actual game data to quantitatively evaluate the statistical properties of deal sequences and the situational advantages of each player on an online mahjong platform. This chapter details the data subject to analysis and the calculation methods for the primary indicators used.

2.1. Analysis Data and Wall Reconstruction
The analysis used an individual's game records from the online mahjong platform "Mahjong Soul." The logs for each game include a server seed, a client seed, and the players' operational history. The analysis program first reconstructs the initial state of the game by calculating SHA256(server_seed|client_seed) and using that hash value as a seed to shuffle a wall consisting of all 136 tiles, including three red dora. Based on this reconstructed wall and the operational history, the deal, draw, and discard sequences for each player are generated.

2.2. Definition of Analytical Metrics
This study uses multiple indicators to analyze the elements of "luck" and "skill" in mahjong from various angles. As central indicators, we define and quantify "initial state advantage," "statistical bias of the sequence," and "in-game advantage."

2.2.1. Initial State Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the element of luck at the start of the game, the following indicators were calculated from the initial 13-tile hand.

Initial Shanten (initial_shanten): The shanten count at the time of the deal. This is a basic indicator of the distance to a winning hand; a smaller number indicates a more advantageous initial state.

Initial Effective Tiles (initial_effective_tiles): This indicates how many tiles that would reduce the shanten count exist in the remaining wall. It is a measure of the future potential for hand improvement.

2.2.2. Statistical Bias of the Sequence (p-value)
A Runs Test was used to evaluate the bias in the "order" of tiles dealt to each player. This is a method to test whether a series of data is statistically random.

Unit of Analysis: The unit of analysis is a time-series list of 31 tiles, consisting of a player's initial 13-tile hand and their subsequent 18 draws.

Binarization and Run Count: Based on the median value of the integer list of tiles, each tile is binarized as "1" (above the median) or "0" (at or below the median). The total number of "runs"—consecutive segments of the same value—is then counted.

P-value Calculation and Judgment: A p-value is calculated from the observed number of runs. If this value is below a pre-set significance level of α=0.0025, the sequence is judged to have a "statistically significant bias."

2.2.3. Composite Advantage Score (advantage_score)
To evaluate the overall advantage during game progression, this study uses a unique composite indicator, advantage_score. This score is calculated with the following formula:

advantage_score = (shanten_adv * 10) + (tsumo_adv * 5) + (fulfillment_rate / 1000)

The components are defined as follows:

Shanten Advantage (shanten_adv): Calculated as (Opponent Average Shanten) - (Own Average Shanten). An indicator of relative advantage showing how much faster one's own hand progressed compared to opponents.

Tsumo Advantage (tsumo_adv): The total number of times a player's shanten count improved (decreased) due to a draw. A direct indicator of good or bad "draw luck."

Fulfillment Rate (fulfillment_rate): Calculated as (Actual final score) - (AI simulation score prediction). This shows how much higher (or lower) a score the player actually achieved compared to the score predicted by an AI's standard play. This element evaluates player-specific performance, such as plays and judgments that exceed the AI's predictions.

2.3. Verification of Test Validity: Random Simulation
To confirm that the statistical test used in this study (Runs Test, α=0.0025) functions as theoretically expected, and to establish a baseline for comparison with the Mahjong Soul data, a large-scale random simulation was conducted.

2.3.1. Random Wall Generation Method
The random walls used in the simulation were generated via the following procedure, which is a theoretically unbiased shuffling method that guarantees every possible permutation has an equal probability of occurring.

Creation of a Single Tile List: All 136 tiles, including three red dora, were stored in a single list (array) without regard to suit.

Full Shuffle: The Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm (as implemented in Python's random.shuffle) was applied to this entire list to randomize the order of the 136 tiles.

2.3.2. Verification of Expected Value via Simulation
Using the random walls generated by the method above, the following simulation was performed.

Number of Trials: 1,000,000 random walls were generated.

Unit of Analysis: From each wall, 4 player sequences were generated, for a total of 4,000,000 time-series lists.

Test Implementation: The p-value calculation test defined in 2.2.2 was applied to these 4,000,000 random sequences.

The result was that 10,360 sequences were judged to have a "statistically significant bias" (p-value < 0.0025). This represents a rate of approximately 0.259% of all trials. This simulation result (0.259%) almost perfectly matches the statistical significance level we set (α=0.0025, or 0.25%). This verifies that the testing methodology used in this study is valid and correctly detects "rare cases" at the theoretically expected frequency on purely random data.

3. Results of a Case Study
...(The chapter title has been changed, and all numerical values have been recalculated and revised based on the final data mahjong_data.tsv)...

The analytical methodology defined in Chapter 2 was applied to the game records of 10 matches (a total of 100 hands, or 400 player-hands) in which a specific player participated on the online mahjong platform "Mahjong Soul." This chapter describes the results of that analysis as objective facts.

3.1. Overview of Analysis
A Runs Test was performed on the 400 time-series lists. As a result, 30 sequences were judged to have a "statistically significant bias" (p-value < 0.0025). This corresponds to 7.5% of the total units of analysis (30/400). This observed rate is approximately 29 times higher than the theoretical expected value of 0.259% verified in section 2.3.2.

3.2. Distribution of Key Indicators
The distributions of the primary indicators across the entire analysis were as follows.

Composite Advantage Score (advantage_score):

Mean: 15.35

Standard Deviation: 19.82

Minimum: -28.00

Maximum: 78.49

The distribution of advantage_score is shown in Figure 1. The distribution is spread around the mean, but it is evident that some instances of extremely high or low values exist.

[Insert Figure 1: Histogram showing the distribution of advantage_score]

3.3. "Initial Luck" vs. "Draw Luck" Matrix Analysis
We defined a "Game Environment Matrix" by combining two "luck" indicators: sequence bias (p-value) and draw utility (tsumo_adv). The dividing lines were set at the significance level for the p-value (0.0025) and the mean for tsumo_adv (3.8 times). Figure 2 shows a scatter plot of all 400 hands on this matrix.

[Insert Figure 2: Scatter plot showing the "Game Environment Matrix"]

Figure 2 visually demonstrates that players were placed in four distinct environments, which we have named "Tailwind," "Headwind," "Storm," and "Revelation." Archetypal examples representing these environments were extracted from the data and are shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Archetypal Examples from the "Game Environment Matrix"
| Category | Hand ID | p-value (Initial Luck) | tsumo_adv (Draw Luck) | initial_shanten (Initial Hand) | fulfillment_rate (vs. AI) | advantage_score (Overall) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tailwind | 202208141844-1-AC | 0.407 | 4 | 3 | 26300 | 78.49 |
| Headwind | 202208141459-3-V | 0.812 | 0 | 3 | -13900 | -13.90 |
| Storm | 202208141732-4-A | 0.00205 | 2 | 3 | -13000 | -10.37 |
| Revelation | 202208111537-9-M | 0.00064 | 2 | 2 | 27400 | 37.38 |
p-values below 0.0025 are shown in bold.

3.4. Relationship between Indicators and Victory
Finally, to analyze the relationship between each indicator and the outcome of the hand, the distributions of the indicators were compared between winning hands and non-winning hands using a box plot (Figure 3).

[Insert Figure 3: Box plot comparing the distribution of indicators for winning vs. non-winning hands]

From Figure 3, it was observed that for winning hands, the median values for tsumo_adv and advantage_score trended clearly higher compared to non-winning hands. On the other hand, no remarkable difference was seen for shanten_adv.

4. Discussion
...(The content has been revised and strengthened based on the new results and the re-defined positioning of the paper)...

In Chapter 3, we visualized the "luck environment" in online mahjong games based on objective indicators. This chapter interprets what these results mean and derives an answer to the central question of this paper: "Does rank fluctuation in online mahjong reflect player skill?"

4.1. Interpretation of the "Luck Environment"
The " 'Initial Luck' vs. 'Draw Luck' Matrix" (Figure 2) presented in Chapter 3 objectively shows the probabilistic conditions each player was placed in on a per-hand basis. This is an attempt to visualize subjective feelings like "flow" or "luck" with data. The "Tailwind" and "Revelation" zones correspond to situations where a player feels "my hand is progressing" or "I'm lucky," while the "Headwind" and "Storm" zones correspond to situations of feeling "nothing is going right" or "the flow is bad." The results of this study show that these diverse "luck environments" do indeed exist during games, independent of the player's will.

4.2. Quantitative Analysis of the Interaction between "Luck" and "Skill"
Given these "luck environments," where does player "skill" come into play? This paper defines "luck" as the "quality of opportunity given to the player" and "skill" as the "ability to make optimal judgments in response to that opportunity," thus separating the two. To delve deeper into this question, we utilize the fulfillment_rate—the deviation of the actual score from an AI's prediction—as an indicator for measuring one aspect of player "skill." The case studies shown in Table 1 clearly illustrate this interaction.

For instance, in the "Storm" case, multiple misfortunes overlap: an extremely rare initial sequence (p-value: 0.00205), a poor initial hand (initial_shanten: 3), and hopeless draw luck (tsumo_adv: 2). Under these harsh conditions, the player's performance was significantly below the AI's prediction (fulfillment_rate: -13000). This is a typical example of unavoidable bad luck directly leading to a poor result.

On the other hand, the "Revelation" case is more suggestive. Although the sequence bias was strong (p-value: 0.00064), the player was blessed with good draws (tsumo_adv: 2) and achieved a result that dramatically exceeded the AI's prediction (fulfillment_rate: +27400). This means that the player took advantage of the good draws in a difficult initial situation to achieve a result far beyond a standard AI's judgment. A high fulfillment_rate under such circumstances can be interpreted as objective evidence of a player's advanced decision-making ability—that is, "skill."

From this, it is possible to functionally separate the two concepts: "luck" is the uncontrollable "environment" represented by indicators such as p-value, tsumo_adv, and initial_shanten, while "skill" is the "adaptive capability" to see how far one's performance (fulfillment_rate) can exceed a standard AI's judgment within that environment.

4.3. The Limitations of Short-Term Performance Evaluation and its Psychological Impact
The analysis in this study shows with objective data that players are probabilistically subjected to both remarkably advantageous "Tailwind" environments and extremely disadvantageous "Storm" environments, completely independent of their own will or skill.

As Table 1 shows, a player can experience a hand that results in a fulfillment_rate of +27400 as well as a hand that results in -13000, both as single hands. The current system, which simply aggregates the results of these hands and determines player standing and rank based on the total score, contains the inherent risk, in the short term, of reflecting the "luck environment" encountered more strongly than the player's "skill."

Therefore, the final answer to the question of this paper is: "Short-term rank fluctuation is the result of a complex interplay of multiple 'luck' factors as presented in this paper, not just skill, and therefore cannot serve as an accurate indicator of a player's skill on its own."

This conclusion offers an important insight for freeing players from excessive psychological stress. Possessing an objective viewpoint that a short-term loss or slump may be due to the possibility of a "statistically disadvantageous environment," rather than attributing it solely to one's own lack of skill, can serve as an "intellectual vaccine" to avoid excessive self-criticism and maintain a healthy mindset toward the game. It is our hope that this research will aid many players in exploring the game of mahjong more deeply and more healthily.

5. Conclusion
This study aimed to answer the question, "Does short-term performance fluctuation in online mahjong accurately reflect player skill?" by proposing an objective analytical method and demonstrating its efficacy as a case study. This chapter summarizes the findings of the entire study and discusses its significance, limitations, and future prospects.

5.1. Summary of this Research
This paper quantified the "luck environment" that players are placed in by analyzing the statistical bias of deal sequences (p-value) and the utility of draws (tsumo_adv) from game records on the online mahjong platform "Mahjong Soul." The findings were as follows:

Statistically significant bias was observed with a frequency approximately 29 times higher than the theoretical expected value in the analyzed sequences.

We visualized that "initial luck" (p-value) and "draw luck" (tsumo_adv) act as independent events, creating four distinct "luck environments."

By analyzing the fulfillment_rate—the deviation from an AI's predicted score—we showed the possibility of objectively evaluating a player's adaptive capability, or "skill," within each environment.

Based on this analysis, this paper reached the conclusion that "short-term rank fluctuation is the result of a complex interplay of multiple 'luck' factors as presented in this paper, not just skill, and therefore cannot serve as an accurate indicator of a player's skill on its own."

5.2. Significance and Limitations of this Research
The academic and social significance of this research can be summarized in three points. First, it presents a new framework for quantifying the ambiguous concept of "luck" using multiple concrete indicators and analyzing it separately from "skill." Second, it shows the potential for this framework to function as an "intellectual vaccine" for players suffering from short-term slumps, allowing them to objectively analyze their situation and alleviate excessive psychological stress. Third, it offers a new perspective for discussions on the nature of "fairness" and "performance evaluation" in online competitive games.

On the other hand, this study has clear boundaries. This research is designed as a case study that deeply analyzes a specific individual's case, differing from a large-scale quantitative study that aims for generalization to a specific population. Therefore, the observed deviation rate of 7.5% is strictly the value within this case study, and applying it to all players is neither the purpose of this research, nor is it possible.

The primary focus of this research is to prove with an objective methodology the fact that 'it is possible for a single player to experience a statistical deviation 30 times greater than the theoretical expected value,' and to propose a framework for its evaluation and analysis. This fact, even as a single example, holds extremely important meaning for discussing the competitiveness and evaluation methods of online mahjong.

5.3. Future Prospects
Based on the limitations of this study, we propose the following three avenues for future work. First, to verify the generalizability of this study's findings by conducting an analysis on a large-scale dataset including more players and more games. Second, to conduct a comparative analysis between different online mahjong platforms to clarify the characteristics of their respective wall generation algorithms. Third, to build a more precise model of player "skill" by analyzing in detail the relationship between fulfillment_rate and specific player decisions (what to call, what to discard, when to riichi, when to defend).

Furthermore, the analysis in this paper does not consider player attributes. If, by using the analytical method proposed here, a systematic difference in the statistical properties of the "luck environment" were to be found between, for example, players who are "streamers" and those who are not, it would raise an extremely important issue regarding the balance between "competitiveness" and "entertainment value" in eSports. This remains a significant research topic for the future.

It is our hope that through such research, an environment where all players can engage with the game more fairly and more healthily will be realized.
